# dotfiles

Setting this up to save my dotfiles over time and to learn git. Feel free to take a look. If you have any advice, I wouldn't mind some unsolicited advice. :)

Fun fact, I originally named this repo "dotfiltes" and had to learn about the difference between adding my remote origins as a HTTPS vs SSH. SSH ftw.
